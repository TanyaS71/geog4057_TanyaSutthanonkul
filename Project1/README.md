# Guided Project 1: Importing JSON Data and Automated Map Layout Creation

1. Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete GIS programming workflow using Python and ArcGIS Pro. 
A JSON dataset containing parcel geometries and attributes for New Orleans land value data was processed and converted into a GIS-compatible format. 
The resulting shapefile was visualized and used to generate a cartographic layout through automated Python scripting.
The primary objective of this project was to develop reusable Python tools for data import, visualization, and layout generation while minimizing manual interaction within ArcGIS Pro.

2. Code Development Workflow
The project was developed in three main stages:
2.1 Data Exploration and Processing
The original JSON file was first explored using a Jupyter Notebook. 
Python’s json module was used to parse attribute data and extract geometries stored in Well-Known Text (WKT) format. 
Because ArcGIS Pro cannot directly import this JSON structure using standard geoprocessing tools, a custom Python workflow was required to convert the data into a shapefile.
2.2 Script Tool Development
After validating the JSON parsing logic in a notebook environment, the code was refactored into a Python script tool (.pyt). 
Hard-coded file paths and parameters were replaced with user inputs, allowing the tool to be executed within ArcGIS Pro. 
This step enabled reproducible data conversion and integration with the ArcGIS interface.
2.3 Automated Data Visualization and Layout Creation
A Python Notebook was used to automate map visualization tasks using the arcpy.mp module. 
The output shapefile was added to the map, and unique values symbology was applied using the Cluster_Le attribute. 
A map layout was then created programmatically, including a map frame, legend, scale bar, and north arrow. 
The final layout was exported to a high-resolution PDF.

3. How to Use the Code
Step 1: Prepare the Data
Place the input JSON file in the data/ directory.
Ensure ArcGIS Pro is installed and licensed.
Step 2: Run the Python Toolbox
Open ArcGIS Pro.
Add project1.pyt to the project.
Select the input JSON file and specify an output shapefile name.
Run the tool to generate the shapefile.
Step 3: Generate the Map Layout
Open the provided Python Notebook (project1_layout.ipynb) in ArcGIS Pro.
Run each cell sequentially.
The notebook will add the shapefile, apply symbology, create the layout, and export the final PDF.

4. Project Output
The final cartographic product generated by this workflow is shown below:
Final Map Layout (PDF): outputs/no_tax_layout.pdf
This layout visualizes parcel clusters using unique values symbology and includes standard cartographic elements such as a legend, scale bar, and north arrow.

5. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be integrated with ArcGIS Pro to automate GIS data processing and cartographic workflows. 
By combining notebooks, script tools, and layout automation, the workflow improves efficiency, reproducibility, and consistency in GIS project development.
